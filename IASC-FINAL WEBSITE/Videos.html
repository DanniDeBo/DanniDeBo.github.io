<h3> How To Make a Video </h3>
  <p> To make a video, there are things you need to do before you can upload your video to Youtube. You need to make a channel.
    And if you want to do that, you need to follow these instructions. </p>

  <p> First, you have to make a gmail account because they use that gmail account to access so you can create the channel.

Once you finished filling out the info, you can now create a Youtube channel. </p>
  <p> Now, what you do is, you go to Youtube and create your channel. From there, you can create your own nickname or whatever you might want to name the channel. But remember,
    the name you choose has to be one that you might want to go by, so choose what's right for you not what you think sounds cool. Make it unique and catchy, so people can remember
    it. Then you make Youtube Videos. But thats when it gets tricky. </p>
  <p> There are many ways you can make videos and put it on Youtube. You can do the simplest to the most professional of work. The simplest is that you use your device
    and use the apps for editing. For example, you can use an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch(or whatever has a camera), film your piece, and find a good editing app from
    Apple store (free or paid) like "Trim and Cut" or "iMovie" are one of the options, and upload it to your Youtube Channel. But there are many pros and cons to this idea.
    one of the most prominent cons is that the megapixels on that device might not be that great dependng on the device you use and if you move alot in the video, your screen
  might not look that great and that's not how you make a good video if you want a bunch of views. </p>
  <p> The next one up from the simplest is the middle ground one for the people who kinda want to do it but they aren't sure. That's not saying that they don't have to use
    the simple method of making videos as well, but it's just not the best. Anyways, the other way you make a video is use a camera and tripod. Like a Canon Rebel camera. Then
    you can use some editing program but that costs money if you dont mind spending some money. You know what they say, "Gotta spend money to make money!" </p>
  <p> The last way, which is the professional way and costs a bunch of money, is getting a big video camera like the cameramen use in movies and basically everything that has to
    do with the movies. Like the mic on the camera, or holding a mic and a big strudy tripod for the videocamera. </p>
