  <h3>What are Youtubers?</h3>
  <p> You might be wondering, what is a youtuber? A youtuber is a person who entertains their audience with videos of
  their own making. Based on this knowledge, anyone who has a channel on youtube is called a youtuber. But there are notable
  youtubers in the Youtube universe such as Dan and Phil, PewdiePie, Markiplier, and Zoella.

  just stereotypical vloggers who just like to talk about their lifes. One gamer youtuber known as Pewdiepie has set a world
  record of the most subscribers on Youtube of 40 million followers as of today. This youtuber had even made up this thing
  called a "Let's Play" where he films himself reacting to the video games that he plays. People tune in into youtube just to
