    Youtube is one of the main social media networks in the world that allow people to express
    themselves so freely. Youtube has been around since 2005 and still going strong in 2015 as it
    celebrates its 10th year of being active. You can basically put whatever you want on it. From How-to videos to cat videos, you can
    basically imagine anything and put it on Youtube and share it on the web for the whole 39
    countries to see. Youtube creates a voice for people who want to show it and to do that you need to make a video.

    one video that they intended to be on to a completely weird video that you wouldn't even suspect
    that video even existed. Youtube has been so famous now, they now promote different companies because
